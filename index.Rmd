Iâ€™m Joe, a data scientist and computational ecologist at UCL interested in the causes and consequences of global pollinator biodiversity change, and the power of online data in quantifying biodiversity awareness. 

I'm currently in the final year of my PhD, based jointly between UCL, the Institute of Zoology, and the RSPB (CASE partnership). My  PhD work has explored a broad spectrum of tools and questions in the context of pollinator biodiversity change, such as the use of text-mining tools to quantify  biases and synthesise research data, the response of global pollinator biodiversity to land-use and climate change, and the potential of Wikipedia data for quantifying change in pollinator biodiversity awareness.

Prior to my PhD I worked at UNEP-WCMC building automated data handling systems for wildlife trade data, and at the journal Scientific Reports in manuscript peer-review and decisions. I also have an MSc (Distinction) in Biodiversity and Conservation and a BSc in Zoology, both from the University of Leeds.
