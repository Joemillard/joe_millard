Iâ€™m Joe, a data scientist and computational ecologist at UCL interested in the causes and consequences of global pollinator biodiversity change, and the power of online data in quantifying biodiversity awareness.

Prior to my PhD I worked at UNEP-WCMC building automated data handling systems for wildlife trade data, and at the journal Scientific Reports in manuscript peer-review and decisions.
