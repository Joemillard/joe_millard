### **Global biodiversity modelling**
My main area of interest is in global biodiversity modelling, particularly animal pollinator response to anthropogenic activity. As part my PhD I modelled the response of pollinator biodiversity to land-use type and intensity, using all likely pollinating species in the PREDICTS database. More recently I'm interested in 


### **Conservation culturomics**
I'm also interested in the emerging field of conservation culturomics, or in other words using online data sources (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, Google Trends) to better understand human-nature interactions. In particular I led the development of the Species Awareness Index (SAI), a new index of changing public biodiversity awareness derived from the rate of change in Wikipedia species page views.
