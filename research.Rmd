### **Global biodiversity modelling**
My main area of interest is in global biodiversity modelling, particularly animal pollinator response to anthropogenic activity. As part my PhD I modelled the response of pollinator biodiversity to land-use type and intensity, using all likely pollinating species in the PREDICTS database. More recently I'm interested in 

### **Conservation culturomics**
I'm also interested in the emerging field of conservation culturomics, or in other words using online data sources (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, Google Trends) to better understand human-nature interactions. In particular I led the development of the Species Awareness Index (SAI), a new index of changing public biodiversity awareness derived from the rate of change in Wikipedia species page views.

![<font size="2">__The Species Awareness Index (SAI) for 6 taxonomic classes (reptiles, ray-finned fishes, mammals, birds, insects, and amphibians) across 10 Wikipedia languages, for the period July 2015-March 2020. Coloured lines represent the mean of the bootstrapped indices at each monthly each time step, and coloured bands the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles: reptiles (black), ray-finned fishes (orange), mammals (blue), birds (green), insects (pink), and amphibians (brown). Taxonomic class panels are ordered by the magnitude of overall increase in each taxonomic class, and for language alphabetically (reproduced from Millard *et al*. 2021)__</font>](Figure_3.png){#id .class width=70% height=70%}

### **Informatics tools in ecology**

![<font size="2">__Global study counts for animal pollinator related studies, aggregated at country level. Study counts were derived from the number of abstracts with their ‘major’ focus in each country. All oceanic and otherwise obviously incorrect mentions, as well as mentions that could only be resolved to a unit larger than a country, were removed. Study counts were log10‐transformed. Partially transparent blue points (‘minor’ mentions) represent the number of unique abstracts in which CLIFF‐CLAVIN resolved that location. ‘minor’ mentions include all specific geographical locations geoparsed by CLIFF‐CLAVIN, with the exception of continents, oceans, and incorrectly geoparsed locations (reproduced from Millard *et al*. 2020)__</font>](abstract_geoparse-major-minor_ratio_14.png){#id .class width=70% height=70%}
