### **Global biodiversity modelling**
My main area of interest is in global biodiversity modelling, particularly animal pollinator response to anthropogenic activity. As part my PhD I combined two datasets to model the global response of local-scale pollinator biodiversity to land-use intensity: 1) the PREDICTS database of global biodiversity records (Hudson *et al* 2017); and 2) a new dataset of likely pollinating species, compiled through a combination of name-entity recognition algorithms and expert consultation (Millard *et al* 2021b). 

Our work shows that low levels of intensity can benefit pollinators, but on anthropogenic land increasing intensity tends to decrease richness and abundance. Our research also shows that pollinator response to land-use intensity differs markedkly among taxonomics groups and geographical zone, with a strongly positive response to increasing fertiliser application rate for flies, and a much stronger response to intensity in tropical relative to non-tropical cropland.

### **Conservation culturomics**
I'm also interested in the emerging field of conservation culturomics, or in other words using online data sources (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, Google Trends) to better understand human-nature interactions. In particular I led the development of the Species Awareness Index (SAI), a new index of changing public biodiversity awareness derived from the rate of change in Wikipedia page views (Millard *et al* 2021a). We calculated this index for 41,197 IUCN species on Wikipedia, including over 2 billion views from the top 10 languages on Wikipedia (by active user). 

Our work shows that awareness of biodiversity is likely marginally increasing, but that change in awareness differs markedly among taxonomic groups and languages. We also show that—over the period July 2015-July 2020—change in awareness is likely not related to either the trade of species or pollination contribution. Biodiversity value likely does relate to awareness, since traded species tend to get a higher number of total views, but our results would suggest that public awareness of the value of biodiversity is not continuing to increase.

### **Informatics tools in ecology**
I also have a much broader interest in informatics tools in ecology, such as text-mining, web-scraping, Shiny app development, AI tools, and satellite telemetry analyses. 

As part of  my PhD I used a set of name-entity recogntion tools (Taxize and CLIFF-CLAVIN) to explore the taxonomic and geographic distribution of the animal pollinator literature. As part of this research we showed that 25% of animal pollinator related abstracts mention a species of honeybee and 20% a species of bumblebee. We further confirmed that the geographic distribution of the animal pollinator literature (Millard *et al* 2020) is restricted to North America and Europe, although there is still a marked quantity of data outside these regions.

I was also involved in building a plant species identifying web app, which would pull images of plants from Flickr (using [photosearcher](https://docs.ropensci.org/photosearcher/articles/photosearcher.html)), predict what plant was in the image (using [PlantNet](https://identify.plantnet.org/)), and then map each image onto geographical space (using [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)). And more recently I've been collaborating with Tom Johnson, Richard Cornford, Dr Manuella Gonzalez-Suarez, and Dr Robin Freeman to further develop the capabilities of automated research synthesis in ecology.

![<font size="2">__Global study counts for animal pollinator related studies, aggregated at country level. Study counts were derived from the number of abstracts with their ‘major’ focus in each country. All oceanic and otherwise obviously incorrect mentions, as well as mentions that could only be resolved to a unit larger than a country, were removed. Study counts were log10‐transformed. Partially transparent blue points (‘minor’ mentions) represent the number of unique abstracts in which CLIFF‐CLAVIN resolved that location. ‘minor’ mentions include all specific geographical locations geoparsed by CLIFF‐CLAVIN, with the exception of continents, oceans, and incorrectly geoparsed locations (reproduced from Millard *et al*. 2020)__</font>](abstract_geoparse-major-minor_ratio_14.png){#id .class width=70% height=70%}
